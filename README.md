• Conducted Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project extensively explored the dataset involving online shoppers' intentions by employing Spark for data manipulation and analysis. This involved loading the data, examining the schema, obtaining descriptive statistics, checking for null values, and analyzing data distribution across various categorical variables. The EDA phase aimed to understand underlying patterns, distributions, and relationships within the dataset.

• Developed Predictive Models: The project constructed and evaluated multiple predictive models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees, and Logistic Regression, to forecast whether a browsing session would result in revenue generation. This involved creating a pipeline for each model, fitting the data, retrieving AUC values, and visualizing ROC curves. Additionally, performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and precision were calculated to assess each model's effectiveness in predicting revenue outcomes from session metrics data.
